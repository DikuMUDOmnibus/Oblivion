The purpose of the Oblivion code base is as thus:


To facilitate a roleplaying environment as opposed to the regular hack and
slash style ofthe original diku and derivatives.

To create a communitee of realms with unique mythos's but sharing in their
coding achievements, and thus benifitting from each other's pool of knowledge.

To allow the individual(s) and administrators to develop their own realm,
lush and vivid with its own life and clarity of purpose, without concern
that their coder might quit on them.

Basically my dream for the Oblivion code base is that knowledge and work 
will be shared by all.  Oblivion only comes with a few areas with the intent
that each admin will create their own unique realm with the help of their 
friends and compatriates filled with mostly original areas.  Hopefully an
archive of "typical" areas which fit different mythos's (fantasy, gothic,
future, etc) in general.  I hope to release future copies of the code base,
all backward compatible with your pfiles and areas.  To help me do this though
people must be willing to submit their changes to be added to the next release
of the stock code.  So unless you are really good at using diff, and patch,
it will be unlikely that you will be able to easily update your mud if you
are making large changes and are not sending them in as you go along.  I hope
to be able to release a new version every 2 months.  This current copy is an 
alpha, I am certain it has many bugs, so I would greatly appreciate if they
were sent in.

Hopefully this will prove as a useful forum for discussion, and if anyone can
appropriate newsgroup space, please feel free to do so.  A 
rec.games.mud.oblivion newsgroup would be welcomed.

I will give technical support to users as time permits.
