~

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Oblivion's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you, as an adventurer, are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight
problems from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are 
worth. 10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces
for the highest quality stones.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
	%h :  Display your current hits
	%H :  Display your maximum hits
	%m :  Display your current mana
	%M :  Display your maximum mana
	%v :  Display your current moves
	%V :  Display your maximum moves
	%x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
	%g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display silver carried
	%a :  Display your alignment
	%r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWNeSeSwNwDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
	%R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
	%z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
	%l :  Display the Language you are currently speaking
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
	Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"
 
~
0 COLOR~
Syntax: color
This command is a toggle to turn your ANSI color off and on.

For extended help on any command, skill or spell, type 'help <topic>'.
SEE THESE HELPS ALSO: death, experience, tick, wizlist. 
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level if you are level 20 or less.
Above 20, you lose a constant 500 XP, and can lose a level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
When a player's corpse decays, the equipment is left on the ground where the
player's corpse was.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    Being part of a group that kills a monster.
    Your skills increasing through use.
    Role-playing.

You lose experience by:

    Fleeing from combat.
    Recalling out of combat.
    Being the target of certain spells.
    Dying.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  When you own a pet, you
receive less experience points when you kill a mob, because your pet helps
you fight - much like fighting in a group.
~

0 PREFIX~
Syntax: prefix <argument>
Syntax: prefix

The PREFIX command will take an argument of any legal command and place 
that argument at your prompt and await for addition or execution.  
Typing PREFIX without an argument will clear your prefix.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST NE NW SE SW UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: ne
Syntax: nw
Syntax: se
Syntax: sw
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in the appropriate direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat. When starting combat
with a combat spell, a target is required.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> silver <character>
Syntax: give <amount> gold <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground. You cannot drop an object
that is cursed or has a nodrop flag.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

TAKE is a synonym for GET.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (worn armor, wielded weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory. (items not worn, wielded, or held).
~

0 NOFOLLOW~

Toggles you character's permission flag regarding following.  You cannot be
followed by anyone when nofollow is on.
~

0 NOSUMMON~

Toggles your character's permission flag regarding summoning.  You cannot be
summoned by anyone when nosummon is on.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects, including
enchantments.  THIS CAN LEAD TO COMPARE INCORRECTLY DECLARING A LESSER
OBJECT AS THE BETTER OF TWO OBJECTS.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

SLEEP SPELL:
Syntax:   cast 'sleep' <victim>
Requires: charm enchantment

This spell attempts to put the victim to sleep.  It is considered
an attack.

See also: INDUCE SLEEP
~

0 REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>


All of these commands send messages to other players.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote ' ' '
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one IMMORTAL player anywhere in the realm.  This form of
communication is entirely OOC, and should never be used for IC messages.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA UNREAD NOTEACH~
The notes on oblivion replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other mud.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list       : show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
note catchup    : marks all notes as read

writing new notes:
note to         : sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
note subject    : sets the subject for a new note
note +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -          : remove a line from a note in progress
note clear      : erase a note in progress
note show       : shows the note you are working on
note post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Four other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and 
penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is
restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.

NOTEACH

Toggles your character's permission flag regarding teaching.  You cannot be
taught any spells when noteach is on.
~

0 OOC . SHOUT YELL QWEST QUESTION ANSWER Q/A QUIET PRAY~
Syntax: ooc      <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: pray     <message>
Syntax: qwest    <message>
Syntax: quiet

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

OOC will send a message to all players in the game without a 
delay.  OOC stands for 'Out-of-character' -- the channel you will want to 
use when discussing conventional (real life) issues.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

QUESTION and ANSWER are used for questions about MUD game mechanics.  This
is an OOC channel, and should NEVER be used for IC questions.

PRAY will allow you to pray to the Immortal of the Temple you are in.

QWEST is used to discuss qwest-related issues while qwests are being
organized and run.

QUIET mode will disable all channels.  You will be able to hear only 
says and emotes.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~

0 EMOTE PMOTE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type SOCIALS for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Airius will be read as bonks you by Airius, and
as bonks Airius by everyone else).
~

0 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start 
using it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is
for armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
~

0 AREAS COMMANDS REPORT SCORE~
Syntax: areas
Syntax: commands
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: weather

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).

WEATHER shows the current game weather.
~

-1 WHO~
Syntax: who

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO.
~

-1 WHOIS~
Syntax: whois <name>
The whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For
example, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.
~

0 DONATE~
Syntax: donate <item>

Places any item in your possession, and not being worn, directly into
the donation pit from anywhere on the MUD.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

-1 APPEND DESC DESCRIPTION~
Syntax: description

To learn what is appropriate to put in your description, type:
help content

Append is an advanced and much more powerful form of the
description command. Upon entering APPEND mode, you will be
shown your present description (or lack of). This can then be
edited, formatted, replaced, cleared, or shown, as per the
following commands.

If you do not have a description, you may just begin entering
your description. After you are finished, press enter to go to
a blank line. If you make a typo, you can use the replace
command to replace the word, or even a whole sentence. When
you are finished, and there are no typos, use the format
command to format the lines to a regulated size. This also
makes the description look much cleaner. Upon formatting, when
you feel you are finished, hit enter to go to a blank line then
type @ and press enter to save iyour description.

If you already have a description, any line you type upon 
entering will be added to the bottom of the current description.
If you wish to start from scratch, use the clear command. Use 
the above instructions for completing the description.

Commands:
.r 'old string' 'new string'  - replaces a given word or string
                                of words. (The quotes are
                                REQUIRED.)

.h  - The help screen, shows a quick list of commands available 
      in the append mode. 

.s  - Shows your current description as you have entered it.

.f  - Format and wordwrap your description to a regulated size.

.c  - Clear the description. Everything. (CAUTION: There is NO 
      warning issued with this command. Be careful.)

@   - End description. This will send you back to the mud and 
      save your description.

Note - All commands must have a . preceding them.
~

-1 CONTENT~
Your description is very important, and others will be able to see it
if they look at you.  You should limit what you put in your description
to those things that someone can actually see.  Be creative, and try to
get across the right impression of your character.  

Things that should NEVER be put in your description:

ACTIONS: 1) Remember, you may not be awake when they look at you, so dont
            whistle, bow, draw daggers etc...
         2) Do NOT tell the reader that THEY perform an action, or feel
            a certain way:
            Ex: "You cower in fear as you look upon me."
                "You feel great respect for me."

Explanations: You should not give information that the reader would not
              normally know:

              "You notice that my shield has been handed down from
               generation to generation within my family."
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 WORTH~
Syntax: worth

Tell you how much gold, silver and experience you have, as well as
experience needed to level.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy, and is not affected by a lethargy spell.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the required key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.
You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the power of your choice, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object, and the
object must be on the ground, it cannot be in your inventory.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disable paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW SELF.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the SPLIT command.
If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically join the fight if
you are in the same room as that character, and you have autoassist ON
(see help autoassist).

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within eight levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other commands for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.

Some objects, such as keys and objects more than 2 levels above you,
may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT divides coins between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
to split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30        --> split 30 silver
split 20 50     --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10     --> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
acquire each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <st qu pr em in co ag sd me re hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class and race, and
several initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute from 1-15%, or to
increase your mana or hp.  You receive one training session per level.

~

-1 ATT ATTRIBUTES~
The 10 attributes that make up each character are:

PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES:
-------------------
Strength:        The ability to use your muscles to their greatest advantage
(ST)             Race plays a large determination in the real strength of your
                 character.

Quickness:       The measure of your reflexes and reaction time.
(QU)

Presence:        The ability to control your own mind - courage, bearing,
(PR)             self-esteem.  It plays a major role your ability to influence
                 others.

Intuition:       The combination of your luck, genius, precognition, ESP, and
(IN)             favor with the gods.

Empathy:         The measure of your relationship to the all-pervading force
(EM)             that is common in all things natural and supernatural.  The
                 strength of your soul.


DEVELOPMENTAL ATTRIBUTES:
-------------------------
Constitution:    Your general health and well being, resistance, and overall
(CO)             durability.

Agility:         Your manual dexterity, and litheness.
(AG)

Self-Discipline: The control of your mind over your body, concentration,
(SD)             steadfastness, and inner strength.  Your ability to go on
                 despite hardship.

Memory:          Your ability to retain knowledge and what you have previously
(ME)             encountered and learned.

Reasoning:       Your ability to absorb and comprehend, as well as to use your
(RE)             knowledge to draw conclusions.

Each attribute is represented in the following manner: CUR (MAX) / MOD

Where CUR is your current percentage in that attribute.  If CUR was 54, then
you are better than 54% of your race in that attribute.  MAX is the highest
possible percentage that you can hope to achieve in that attribute.  MOD is
the modifier that you character receives on various die rolls and checks
that will be performed on your character.  The value of MOD is determined
by looking at your CUR, any equipment modifiers, and any racial bonus that
you received for your race.

~

100 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

100 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, etcetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

98 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

99 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
        shutdown

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~


96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
        newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to oblivion. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 92), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least level 99 to wizlock the game.
~

99 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

97 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

97 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

93 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

96 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
        sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

96 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
        load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.

See also: CLONE, VNUM, STAT
~

98 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
        set obj   <object> <field> <value>
        set room  <number> <field> <value>
        set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
        set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use STRING to change the strings on an object or mobile.

See also: STRING, STAT
~

95 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
        string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

95 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
        noemote   <character>
        noshout   <character>
        notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or notell'ed will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (ic, ooc, Q/A, qwest) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

94 SETSAC~
Syntax: setsac <player> <text>

Changes who the target player's sacrifices go to.
~

97 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
        pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

96 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
        purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

96 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore room
        restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

97 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

95 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
        transfer all
        transfer <character> <location>
        transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

94 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
        gecho <message>
        pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

92 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

92 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
        wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 100 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

92 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~ 

92 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

96 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
        vnum <obj or mob> <name>
        vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.

See also: LOAD
~

92 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
        stat mob  <name>
        stat obj  <name>
        stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return an object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.

See also: GOTO, TRANSFER
~

93 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

92 PINFO~
Syntax: pinfo

Shows levels, alignments, races, classes, and PK information for all 
currently connected players.
~

95 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

92 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

99 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

95 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

94 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
        return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

92 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

92 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immortals.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~
92 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
Oblivion has the following races for player characters:

Race       CP  Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Avian      35  Winged race, good clerics, mages and druids.
Draconian  25  Reptilian race, good warriors and thieves.
Drow       21  Dark elves.
Dwarf       8  Good warriors, clerics, paladins, and rangers.
Elf         5  Good mages, thieves, and spellfilchers.
Gnoll      16  Unnatural creatues, born of magic.
Gnome       5  Good mages, clerics, and druids.  
Half-Elf    4  Good mages, thieves, and spellfilchers.
Half-Orc    6  Good warriors and barbarians.  
Halfling    8  Good mages, thieves, and spellfilchers.
Human       0  Jack of all trades - the standard race.
Orc         8  Good warriors and barbarians

Different races have different starting statistics, and also different
stat maximums.

Creation points increase the amount of experience it takes to gain a level.
For more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf')
~

-1 'AVIANS'~
Avians are descendants of Deities.  Being a winged race, they have fragile
bones, making them unsuited for heavy combat or war.  Yet the Avians also
have some advantages - their superior mental capacity, and their ability to
fly make them ideal mages and clerics.  They have also developed a heightened
sense of vision, which they can use to their advantage.
~

-1 'DRACONIANS'~        
Draconians are a race of dragon like people.  In many realms they are
are sterile, and cannot produce offspring.  When they were created in this 
realm, a mistake was made, and they were able to reproduce.  They went off,
leaving their lives of servitude, and formed their own city.  It is well
hidden, for they hold a grudge against all other races for how they were 
treated.  Because they are like dragons, they do have wings, giving them the
ability to constantly fly.  Also, because they are part dragon, they are
naturally resistant to all the elements...Fire, Lightning(weather), Cold,
and Acid.  If you were to look directly at a Draconian, their eyes would show 
pure hatred, and a want for war.  They excel in fighting abilities, and
are often very strong.  Because they are so close to dragons, they are 
feared almost as much as dragons are.  If you were to even think of engaging
battle with a Draconian, watch out...they have sharp claws and teeth, as well
as a tail, and may end up using them in combat.
~

-1 'DWARF' 'DWARVES'~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for their foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and clerics, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They receive the berserk skill for free
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~ 

-1 'ELF' 'ELVES'~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or clerics.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves receive the sneak and hiding
skills automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~

-1 'HUMAN' 'HUMANS' 'MAN'~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all classes.
~

-1 'DROW'~
Unlike normal elves, which inhabit the forests, the drow live underground
and harbor a deep-seated hatred of their elven brothers.  
~

-1 'HALFLING' 'HALFLINGS'~
These small, agile humanoids are quite intelligent, and make excellent
mages and thieves.  They are of much slighter build than dwarves, and
even shorter.
~

-1 'HALF-ELF' 'HALF-ELVES'~
Half human, half-elf they are looked down upon by both races as half-breeds.
They are not quite as agile as true elves, but they are built more solidly,
and do not have the weaknesses of elves either.
~

-1 'HALF-ORC' 'HALF-ORCS'~
Not quite as strong as true orcs, but not quite as dumb either.
~

-1 'ORC' 'ORCS'~
What they lack in brains, they make up for in brawn.  These large humanoids
make excellent fighters and barbarians, but wouldn't even know how to hold
a book.
~

-1 'GNOLL' 'GNOLLS'~
Created by an evil wizard that combined gnomes and trolls, gnolls are
feared by most of the other races.  Little is known about gnolls,
except that nature did not create them.
~

-1 'GNOME' 'GNOMES'~
This race of small tinkerers has always been very intelligent and wise,
and thus they make excellent mages and clerics.
~

-1 'WANDS' 'STAVES' 'SCROLLS'~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, you may fail when you try, possibly destroying
it.  The item skills are as follows:

scrolls - The reading of magical scrolls, tomes and books.
staves  - The use of staves and similar devices.
wands	  - The use of wands and similar items. 

See Also: BRANDISH, RECITE, ZAP
~
 
-1 'GROUP HEADER'~
The following skills and groups are available to your character:
(this list may be seen again by typing list)
~

-1 'GROUP HELP'~
The following commands are available:

list         display all groups and skills not yet bought

premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group
drop <name>  discard a skill or group
info <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group
help <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics

~

-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
Choice (add,drop,learned,list,help,done)?~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The oblivion skill system allows you to fully customize your character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills - sometimes at a reduced cost. The experience breakdown
is as follows: 

Points   Exp/lvl     Points   Exp/lvl
  40       1000        90       6000
  50       1500       100       8000
  60       2000       110      12000
  70       3000       120      16000 
  80       4000       130      24000

The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.  Some races
and classes have a minimum Exp/lvl above 1000.
~

-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
The basic skills:

set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall      essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls     reading of scrolls and other magical volumes

~

-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is
as follows:

SKILLS:

scan            allows you to look before you leap
dodge           avoid blows in combat

REALMS:

alteration      spells that change the nature of things
evocation       offensive magics, used for combat

phantasm        magics for deceiving

SPHERES:

fire            fire related spells
~

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive array of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

SKILLS:

fast healing    recover from your wounds quickly
meditation      recover your mana quickly
scan            allows you to look before you leap

REALMS:

abjuration      spells that protect, cure, and dispel 
alteration      spells that change the nature of things
conjuration     spells that create, transport, and protect
divination      spells that detect and investigate
necromancy      spells that affect physical condition
summoning       spells that transport people/things

SPHERES:

combat          offensive magics
healing         spells that restore the physical condition
plant           plant and poison related spells
protection      defensive magics
~

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

SKILLS:

backstab        the art of attacking from the shadows
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           avoid blows in combat
hide            the art of remaining undetected in a room
mace            the use of maces and other blunt weapons
peek            used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock       a useful skill for breaking and entering
second attack   with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
sneak           move undetected from room to room
sword           swordplay and fencing
trip            a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and clerics.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

SKILLS:

bash            a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
rescue          allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
third attack    allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
~

-1 DRUID 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~
Druids have talents similar to clerics, but with a tendency towards nature.
They can cast an extremely wide variety of spells, but are not adept with
weapons in combat.  Their default skill package includes:

SKILLS:

dagger          the ability to fight with knives
hand to hand    the art of fighting without a weapon

animal          animal related spells
earth           earth related spells
fire            fire related spells
plant           plant and poison related spells
water           water related spells
weather         weather related spells
~

-1 RANGER 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~
A subclass of warrior that has the ability to dabble in both mage and cleric
spells.  This is quite a versatile class that provides a bit of everything,
including sword and second attack, and has the following defaults:

SKILLS:

awareness        wake up when someone approaches as you sleep
scan             allows you to look before you leap
sneak            move undetected from room to room
spear            this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
third attack     allows the skilled ranger to land three blows in one round

REALMS:

abjuration      spells that protect, cure, and dispel 
divination      spells that detect and investigate
evocation       offensive magics, used for combat

SPHERES:

combat          offensive magics
healing         spells that restore the physical condition
~

-1 PALADIN 'PALADIN BASICS' 'PALADIN DEFAULT'~
These is a class of warrior that prides itself on service and duty.  They
place honor above all else, and their devotion has gained them the ability
to heal much like a cleric.  Their default package is as follows:

SKILLS:

fast healing    recover from your wounds quickly
scan            allows you to look before you leap
second attack   with training, the skilled paladin can hit twice as fast
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
third attack    allows the skilled paladin to land three blows in one round

REALMS:

abjuration      spells that protect, cure, and dispel 
divination      spells that detect and investigate
necromancy      spells that affect physical condition

SPHERES:

combat          offensive magics
healing         spells that restore the physical condition
law             enforce the laws of nature
protection      defensive magics
~

-1 BARBARIAN 'BARBARIAN BASICS' 'BARBARIAN DEFAULT'~
These fierce warriors were born to fight.  They can enter into a berserker
rage, and attack in a frenzy.  They are so tough, they have a naturally
lower armor class.  Their default group contains:

SKILLS:

dodge           avoid blows in combat
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
fast healing    recover from your wounds quickly
hand to hand    the art of fighting without a weapon
scan            allows you to look before you leap
second attack   with training, the skilled barbarian can hit twice as fast
ultra damage    deal out tremendous amounts of damage
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
~

-1 SPELLFILCHER 'SPELLFILCHER BASICS' 'SPELLFILCHER DEFAULT'~
This class has the skills of both the thief and mage classes.  This
nasty combination allows you to use both physical and magical means
to deceive and achieve your desires.  Spellfilchers know the dagger
and stealing right off the bat.  Their default skill group includes:

SKILLS:

backstab        the art of attacking from the shadows
second attack   with training, the skilled spellfilcher can hit twice as fast

REALMS:

abjuration      spells that protect, cure, and dispel 
alteration      spells that change the nature of things
enchantment     spells that modify weapons and armor
evocation       offensive magics, used for combat
illusion        magics for concealing 
phantasm        magics for deceiving
~

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster   skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe             the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger          the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail           skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace            this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm         the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear           this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword           the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip            the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic          the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

0 'REALMS' 'REALM' 'SPHERES' SPHERE'~
On Oblivion, spell casters must study certain Realms and Spheres
of magic in order to be able to obtain and cast spells.  Each
spell requires certain realms and/or spheres as specified in
each spell's help text.  You should practice your realms and
spheres as high as possible to increase the chances that you
will receive spells within that realm/sphere upon leveling.
It will also increase your chances of teaching and/or learning
the appropriate spells as well.

REALMS:

Abjuration       Alteration         Charm           Conjuration
Divination       Enchantment        Evocation       Illusion
Invocation       Necromancy         Phantasm        Summoning

SPHERES:

Air              Animal             Combat          Creation
Earth            Fire               Healing         Law
Plant            Protection         Sun             Time
Water            Weather            Wild Magic
~

-1 STUDY~
Syntax: study <scroll>

You can learn spells by reading scrolls.  You must have all the required
realms and spheres, and you must be of high enough level.  This will
freeze your character for a while and use up the scroll, even you are
unsuccessful.
~

-1 SORCERY~
Allows you to cast spells up to 20 levels above your current level.
This power has been known to be unpredictable....
~

-1 'MANA FOCUSING'~
Reduces mana consumption when casting spells by up to 50% in the
best cases.
~

-1 TEACH~
Syntax: teach <character> <spell>

The person being taught must be resting.  This will cause both the
teacher and student to be frozen for a while, even if unsuccessful.
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, 
weapon skill, backstab skill, and the power of the opponent.  Only thieves
and spellfilchers may learn the backstab skill.
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  It's success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  It's effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~

-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled in both your own and your opponent's weapon.  Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both the parrying weapon and the attacker's weapon.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm.  Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- although a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including
sneaking by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, when walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common students.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers guard their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~ 

0 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax:   cast 'detect good'
Requires: divination
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

0 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax:   cast 'dispel good' <victim>
Requires: abjuration
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax:   cast 'recharge' <item>
Requires: enchantment invocation

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

0 SLOW~
Syntax:   cast 'slow' <target>
Requires: alteration

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also doubles movement costs and halves healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

0 PLAGUE~
Syntax:   cast 'plague' <target>
Requires: healing necromancy

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

0 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax:   cast 'create rose'
Requires: conjuration

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax:   cast 'giant strength' <character>
Requires: alteration
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

0 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax:   cast 'chain lightning' <target>
Requires: evocation

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell, but the caster
himself will not be struck unless no other viable target remains.  Chain
lightning is most effective when used on groups of creatures.
~

0 FARSIGHT~
Syntax:   cast 'farsight'
          cast 'farsight' <direction>
Requires: divination

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

0 MASS HEALING~
Syntax:   cast 'mass healing' 
Requires: healing necromancy

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

0 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax:   cast 'floating disc'
Requires: conjuration summoning

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the
caster around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear
of weight penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level
in hours, and usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the
caster, with a maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires
an open float location on the character, and the only way to remove
the disc is to die or allow it to run out of energy.
~

0 FIREPROOF~
Syntax:   cast 'fireproof' <object>
Requires: abjuration enchantment fire

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
        alias <word>
        alias <word> <substitution>
        unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be substituted at this time.
~

0 ADD DEMOTE OUTCAST PROMOTE SEEK~
Syntax:
add     <player>
demote  <player>
outcast <player>
promote <player>
seek    <clan>

In order to add a player to your clan you must have the authority to do so.
Also, that player must currently be "seeking" your clan.

To outcast a player requires authority and will remove them from your clan.

To Promote a player will increase their rank by one.  You cannot promote 
someone any higher then one rank below you.

To Demote a player will decrease their rank by one. You can only demote players
that are lower in rank then you.

To seek to join a clan, type seek <clanname> and hopefully they will notice you.

See also: FOUNDING as well as specific helps on clans(help clanname)
~

0 FOUNDING~

To found a clan you must have at least 8 followers above the level of 10, which
will mean 9 total members including yourself.  To petition - you must email 
Airius (airius@dnaco.net) with at least this information:

-The color you would like your who clan name to be.
~

0 PKINFO~

This will give you all your information on how long you must wait to "Out of 
Level" kill again (Killing a newbie level 10 or below), how long you are safe from 
being pkilled, how long you must wait to recall and or quit.  You also get
your total time of pkilling and being pkilled.
~

0 CHANNEL~
Syntax: channel #
        channel # <target>

Channel without a target converts hit points into mana, the rate of conversion
is usually about 50% but it varies quite sporadically.

Channel with a target sends mana across the mud to someone, but they as well
must have the channel skill and the amount of mana sent is checked for by the
skills of both the target and the recipient.

a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with 
drastically reduced effectiveness.

Requires: alteration evocation water

Syntax:   cast 'fire shield' <character>

is up to 50% of the damage received and is of the appropriate type,
fire or cold, based on the type of shield.
~

0 'MITHRIL GLAZE'~
Syntax:   cast 'mithril glaze' <object>
Requires: alteration enchantment

This spell will add a mana bonus attribute to any object worn around the
body, like robes, at a great cost.  It will destroy the first mithril
item in your inventory (always), and it has a 40% chance of destroying
the object that you cast it on.  If the target object is not destroyed,
it will raise it's level by 5.  You must have at least 200 mana to start
casting it, and it will use all of your mana upon finishing.  It will
make you hungry, thirsty, and 30 hours more tired.
~

0 'CHAOS LACE'~
Syntax:   cast 'chaos lace' <object>
Requires: enchantment wild magic

This spell removes certain flags currently on an item like anti-evil, flaming,
etc.  It can be cast on the following object types, with these possible

~

0 'DRAIN BLADE' 'RUNIC BLADE' 'FROST BLADE' 'EMPOWER BLADE' 'FLAME BLADE'~
Syntax: cast 'drain blade'   <weapon>, Requires: enchantment necromancy
Syntax: cast 'empower blade' <weapon>, Requires: enchantment evocation
Syntax: cast 'flame blade'   <weapon>, Requires: enchantment fire
Syntax: cast 'frost blade'   <weapon>, Requires: enchantment water
Syntax: cast 'runic blade'   <weapon>, Requires: enchantment

These spells give weapons special powers for the duration of the spells.
DRAIN BLADE allows casters of EVIL alignment to give their blade
vampiric powers.  RUNIC BLADE makes the weapon vorpal.  FROST BLADE and
FLAME BLADE make the weapon either very cold or flaming, useful against
victims vulnerable to those extreames. FROST BLADE and FLAME BLADE cannot
be used  simultaneously. EMPOWER BLADE makes the weapon charged with
electricity, and shoots the victim with a lightning bolt whenever it hits.
~

0 'PORTAL'~
Syntax:   cast 'portal' <target>
Requires: conjuration enchantment

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

0 'NEXUS'~
Syntax:   cast 'nexus' <target>
Requires: conjuration enchantment

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

0 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax:   cast 'heat metal' <target>
Requires: fire invocation

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

0 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax:   cast 'holy word'
Requires: combat conjuration summoning

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the cleric coupled with powerful
blessings on the cleric's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral clerics)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.
~

0 FRENZY~
Syntax:   cast 'frenzy' <target>
Requires: evocation summoning

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

0 CALM~
Syntax:   cast 'calm' 
Requires: charm enchantment law

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violent
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

0 HASTE~
Syntax:   cast 'haste' <target>
Requires: alteration

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

0 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION FIRE' 'PROTECTION COLD'
   'PROTECTION LIGHTNING'~
Syntax:   cast 'protection cold',      Requires: abjuration water
          cast 'protection evil',      Requires: abjuration
          cast 'protection fire',      Requires: abjuration fire
          cast 'protection good',      Requires: abjuration
          cast 'protection lightning', Requires: abjuration

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
type, and improves saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both cold/fire or evil/good
defenses at the same time.
~

-1 MOOT~
Syntax: moot <character> <type> <varies>

*** NOBLES ONLY ***

This command starts a moot of one of the following types:

1)reward  - Used to grant or remove experience points from a character for
            good or bad role-playing.  The number of experience points
            of the moot is specified in <varies>, and it takes over 50%
            approval to pass.

2)induct  - Used to grant noble status to a non-noble character.  It takes
            2000 votes to start, and requires a 70% approval to pass.

3)outcast - Used to remove noble status from a character.  It takes 4000
            votes to start, requires a 80% approval to pass, and requires
            at least 5000 approving votes to pass.

4)change  - Used to change a character's alignment.  It takes 500 votes
            to start, and requires a 60% approval to pass.  It uses the
            following for <varies>: <alliance|tendency> <+|-> Where
            alliance is good|evil, and tendency is law|chaos.  It 
            will modify the appropriate alignment value by on in the
            specified direction if it passes.

The initial votes to start any type of moot do NOT count in the approval
totals.

~

0 ALIGNMENT~

Alignment is used to represent the values and beliefs that are inside
each Player Character (PC) to help explain why they act the way they do.

This applies to ALL actions performed by EVERY PC - including the
slaying of mobs, talking in the pit, helping other PCs with
advice/equipment, or assisting in Corpse Retrievals (CRs).

The following definitions should be consulted for you to pick the
proper label for the way you plan to act on Oblivion.  Once an
alignment is selected, actions performed outside that alignment
are punishable by alignment changes, loss of experience, and worse -
so choose wisely!  

Role-Playing (RP) means you must learn to keep seperate your personal
alignment from that of your character, unless of course you have
chosen to RP a character with the same alignment as yourself.

A high level summary:  Law/Neutral/Chaos is the means and
Good/Neutral/Evil is the result or your actions.

Law vs Chaos
------------
The standard Cop versus Criminal philosophical differences.

Law - The belief that in order for happiness and safety to exist, a
set of external laws must be followed and obeyed, regardless of the
consequences.  A lawful character believes that all laws must be
obeyed for society to prosper, including those laws that he does
not agree with.  A lawful person does not tolerate those that break
the law.

Chaos - The belief that laws and strictures restrict the happiness of
an individual, and society will be better off without these
restrictions.  In order for a person to achieve the most in life,
they must not be held back by restrictions imposed by others, and
they should be allowed to do whatever they feel like doing.

Neutral (Law/Chaos) - This is either not being able to understand the
concept of a society's laws [wild animals]; or having a personal set
of laws to live by that are close to that of society, but not identical.
This can be simplified to "Laws are important, but I don't mind breaking
little laws, or breaking laws in small ways".  They are always true
to their own personal set of laws.


Good vs Evil
------------
Good and Evil are opposites and seek to destroy each other.

Good -  The belief that by being fair, just, and nice to others, one
should receive the same treatment in return.  A good person places
the needs of others before their own needs, and as long as everyone
acts this way, the world will be a better place.  A good person does
NOT tolerate the actions of evil people, because it places the good
person at great risk to have someone around that is selfish and does
not place the needs of others before their own.  Good always seeks to
destroy evil, and never harms other good people.

Evil - Evil people lust for pain and suffering, and feel they must dish
it out, before they get it.  Do unto others BEFORE they do unto you.
The evil person actually enjoys being cruel to others, so has no second
thoughts of performing evil acts for the entertainment value alone.  The
evil person does things solely for their own benefit, always placing
their needs above the needs of others.  Evil people have no difficulty
destroying other evil people, as well as good people, if it benefits them.

Neutral (Good/Evil) - The neutral philosophy advocates that both of
the opposing philosophies of good and evil are too extreme.  A neutral
person is open to all ideas, and either strives to keep a balance between
good and evil, by always siding with the weaker, or treating both sides
equally, thus not endorsing one over the other.


Oblivion has a multi-level alignment system that uses the following values:

Law vs Chaos                              Good vs Evil
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+3 = Totally Lawful, no exceptions        +3 = Totally Good, no exceptions
+2 = Mostly Lawful                        +2 = Mostly Good
+1 = Neutral with Lawful Tendencies       +1 = Neutral with Good Tendencies
 0 = Totally Neutral                       0 = Totally Neutral
-1 = Neutral with Chaotic Tendencies      -1 = Neutral with Evil Tendencies
-2 = Mostly Chaotic                       -2 = Mostly Evil
-3 = Totally Chaotic                      -3 = Totally Evil

See also: LAWFUL GOOD, LAWFUL NEUTRAL, LAWFUL EVIL, NEUTRAL GOOD,
          TRUE NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL EVIL, CHAOTIC GOOD, CHAOTIC NEUTRAL,
          CHAOTIC EVIL.
~

-1 'LAWFUL GOOD'~

The LG person completely believes in the laws of their society, and most
societies in general.  However, this attitude is modified by the fact that
the LG person also looks at the SPIRIT of the law, as well as the letter
of the law.  They would like to see the laws that they are familiar with
applied universally, regardless of the situation.  They will seek out and
destroy evil ONLY as permitted by the laws of society.

Ex: City Guard

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'LAWFUL NEUTRAL'~

Like the LG person, the LN also completely believes in the Law.  But they
are focused on the LETTER of the law.  If they give their word to someone,
they will honor it - regardless of treachery on the other's part.  They feel
that ALL laws should be obeyed; regardless of the intent behind it or even
the overall merit. They live to follow orders.

Ex: Judge

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'LAWFUL EVIL'~

As with other Lawful types, they too believe in Law.  However, they work
within the laws to benefit themselves.  They do whatever is necessary to
advance within society's hierarchy, as giving orders puts them in a place
of power.  They will sometimes honor the letter of the law, and sometimes
the spirit of the law - depending on which is to their advantage.  The 
laws they follow are external laws dictated by their society, but they
find a way to be as cruel as possible within those laws.

Ex: Mafia Boss

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'NEUTRAL GOOD'~

External laws are not as important for the NG person.  Their focus is more
on what is good for society in general.  They take the long view when
considering the implications of their actions.  These folks will take the
time to consider an action before acting on it.  They do what they do for
the overall good of society, even if they need to break a few laws to do it.

Ex: Robin Hood

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'TRUE NEUTRAL'~

People of this alignment are for the overall balance of the universe.
Law, Chaos, Good, Evil; all are irrelevant.  ANY will be used to maintain
WHATEVER is seen as the balance to that person, and this can be a VERY extreme
view.  A true neutral realizes that there cannot be life without death, and there
cannot be good without evil; a true neutral can either always take the side of
the underdog, or just treat everyone equally.

Ex: Arbitrator

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'NEUTRAL EVIL'~

They take the long view on what is best for themselves.  Contrary to most
people's thinking, this is the nastiest of the evil alignments.  This is
because all NEs are following some predetermined, 'selfish' goal.  If you can
find out what this goal is, you have half a chance of predicting what they will
do.  Many NEs have a personal code of honor that can make them seem
LE, but because in the end there can be only the self, it places them
firmly in the NE camp.  They follow their own internal rules to maximize
the cruelty and destruction they can perform to those around them.

Ex: Informant

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'CHAOTIC GOOD'~

The CG if more concerned with the Good of the self.  They will happily
ignore any law that restricts their personal freedom.  They tend to take the
short view of their actions, never considering the long range consequences.
They like to defend other's individual rights as well, even if those others
DON'T want their rights defended.  They do not stand by and let evil take
advantage of good for any reason.  They will seek out and destroy evil at
will.

Ex: Vigilante (Dirty Harry)

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'CHAOTIC NEUTRAL'~

These people are fully into Chaos.  They don't care about the good and evil of
their actions or even the world; they just want Chaos to flow freely.  This
does not mean acting on whatever whim comes along - CNs can have a long range
plan.  One year they could start a peasant revolt against a tyrant; and then
come back in a couple of years and help with a military coup.  As long as there
is a state of upheaval and confusion, they're happy.  They are typically loners.

Ex: Mercenary

See also: ALIGNMENT
~

-1 'CHAOTIC EVIL'~

These folks are into evil in and of itself.  They don't really look to the
future.  If they can cause pain and suffering right now, they do it.
Strength is all important - might makes right, and all that.  Anything to
further the spread of evil and destruction, even if it means death in their
own group.  CEs that are truly dedicated to the cause tend not to live very
long.

Ex: Serial Killer

~

-1 BAGHEERA~
The Cat Warrior wipes her bloody claws off on the ground leaving the king
of the marauding clan as her last dead.  Silently she wanders into the desert
finally avenging the deaths of her clan, but the loss within her will never be
sated.  The avatar/patron of the Bagheera is the Cat Warrior.  Until her return 
to the mortal plane, we follow her example.  We are quiet, loyal and fierce.
We help our fellow tribe members to gain in power, because the gain of one
benefits the whole clan.  We also protect each other, and an offense against
one will be revenged by the whole clan, and the punishment shall be as per the 
offense.  We will also often help others in need if they ask, under the
assumption that they too will help us in case we are in need.  The tribe helps
each other in all things and are a tight group. We wait for the avatar of the 
cat's return.
We accept members from all races and alignments assuming they desire to join
and agree with our laws, and are willing to follow the cat.  If you would
wish to join us please talk to a member of the clan, and someone in the clan
will add you, or just "seek Bagheera" and we will talk to you.  We generally 
leave those alone who leave us alone, but if bothered cat-like we pounce.
~

-1 FLIGHT FALCON~
The Flight of the Falcon is a group of individuals that bear the mark of the
Falcon and are bound together by their pledge to serve goodness and combat evil.
The clan chooses the Falcon as its symbol because it is a bird of prey - strong,
proud, and fierce.  The freedom of the Falcon is symbolic of the fact that the
preservation of the light is the primary concern of the clan, and they are not
constrained by the law.

The clan has 5 Ranks: Heart, Talon, Wing, Eye, and Nestling.

Member Alignment Requirements:

Goodness      Law/Chaos
--------------------------
2 or 3           Any
   1            2 or 3
   0              3

If you wish to bear the mark of the Falcon, type: seek flight

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~

-1 OBLIVION~
Oblivion is Rom derived source code written by Airius(Wes Wagner),
it was meant to be a more roleplaying oriented version of ROM,
and was made possible by the help of many people over the years. 
The final release will hopefully have full credits, and I would hope you 
would all post them.
~

-1 IMMAPPLY~
If you wish to apply for immortalship you should email the department head
of the position for which you are applying.  Application does not require
us to interview you, interviews will be at the sole discretion of the 
department head.

You should send a resume including but not limited to:
	-Previous Experience
	-References
	-Time spent on Oblivion
	-Plan of what your strengths are
	-Plan of what you could do to improve the MUD

Higher level characters who have spent more time on Oblivion itself will often
be considered before others.

~

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 92
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)
~

-1 SOCIALS~
 
The SOCIALS command lists all of the available role-playing commands.
These commands are used to help your character express their feelings,
show their emotions, and just plain have fun!  Role-Playing is
required on Oblivion, so give these commands a try.  Note that although
these commands allow you to do some interesting things with other people,
they do no actual damage (hp) in any way; however, if you upset someone,
they might take offense, and then.............
~

-1 MERC~

92 IMOTD~
Welcome Immortal!

	Hello and welcome, there is much to be done as you know, let us
make it so.  Please keep in mind the following:
	-Due to the lower player base we need to be more newbie friendly
	-With regards to newbies instill Roleplaying in them early
	-If you can devote more on line time so we can make a presence even
	   if it means working in another window and being logged on the same
	   time as I often do.
	-Do not let mortals who are being abusive OOC go unchecked, I myself
	   will not tolerate people being rude or abusive to each other OOC,
	   I ask that you do not as well.
	-Do not be afraid to take some initiative, just do not go too far.

Thank you for your work and support,
-Airius

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
Player Killing is possible on Oblivion, you can legally pk anyone who is not 
level 10 or below.  You can actually pk someone who is level 10 or below
you, but when you do so, you will activate a timer that prevents you from
OOLing(out of level) for a long period of time.  Also when you are pkilled,
you get a 30 hour safe timer which will prevent anyone from attacking
you, but if you attack someone else your timer will be reset to 0. All methods
of pkilling are legal, except for the use of summon. 

Stealing from players is allowed, but you may not steal from someone more
than 7 levels above you.  There are also safe rooms which prevent stealing
entirely.

92 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
			***********************
		      ** The Rules of Oblivion **
			***********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot unless an emergency arises.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quests are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

~

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of ROM.  For other matters, use common sense.

* Limited player stealing or player killing.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to the implementor.
 
* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch
  you doing it, you will be deleted.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment. ALL CHARACTERS involved may be
  deleted, first offense.
 
* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
  done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
  and carry a black stick.

* Trolling for players for other muds is hazardous to your internet access, I 
  make it a policy to track down trollers(first offense) and report them to
  the admin of their site.   

* No kill assisting, you may not weaken another mob with the intent for someone
  else to kill it for experience.  Healing a character in battle, spelling them 
  up etc is legal, but do not hurt a mob to the point of near death just so 
  another character can gain the experience points.

~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
 
0 HEALER~
The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~ 

-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~

92 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your possession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

auto, autolist  : show the current settings of the following:

autoassist      : Makes you help other group members in combat.
autoexit        : Display room exits upon entering a room.
autogold        : Take all gold and silver from dead mobiles.
autoloot        : Take all items from dead mobiles.
autosac         : Sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpses)
autosplit       : Split up spoils from combat among your group members.

Typing a command sets the action, typing it again removes it. 
~ 

-1 CLAN~
   A Clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further
a common cause.  Each clan has rules and regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".   To
join a Clan you must be level 5 or above and level 90 or below.
Speak to the Clan Leader about joining.  
   Joining a Clan is a dangerous step.  Many adventurers live to 
kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will cross.
Remember, attacking or killing fellow clan members *IS* illegal except to 
mutiny your Clan leader.
   Existing Clans may buy special rooms and mobiles by acquiring 
diamonds as payment.  To see room prices, type "help prices".  New
Clans may be formed by petitioning the immortals.  Please remember that 
their word is final on all matters not covered by this help.

~

-1 PRICES PRICE~
New Clan Hall Rooms cost 40 diamonds.
Boosting the mana or healing gains for a room costs 200 diamonds.
Both in the same room costs triple.
Help Files are 1/4 diamond per line (blank lines not included).
~

-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~ 
 
-1 GATE~
Syntax:   cast gate <target>
Requires: conjuration summoning

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters receive a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.
~

-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~
This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
